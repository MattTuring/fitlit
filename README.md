## Description

The goal of this project was to create a data dashboard for an activity tracker based on a multiple provided data bases. We were challenged to present a useful dashboard for a user to view and see their latest activity data, goals and milestones. As well as to compare their activity to other users. The final product should be modular, reusable code that follows SRP(Single Responsibility Principle). All while using object and array protoype methods to perform data manipulation.
